## Config File:
A config file must be created on your individual computer to hold TBA auth keys, passwords, etc. It is not committed to github.

The file should be called config.py and the structure of the file should look like this:
```
TBA_AUTH_KEY = 'your-auth-key-here'
OTHER_SECRET_STUFF = 'super-secret'
```
